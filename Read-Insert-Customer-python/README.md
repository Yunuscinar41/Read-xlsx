# Read-xlsx
reading excel file(xlsx) and insert data to the certain mysql database.

I made an interface to make the application easier to use.

In interface, there are 5 labels, 5 linedits and a button. First, user fill the lineedits for the database informations and excel file path. Once thet finish filling in the blanks, they has to click button that says 'read' on it. If the read and insert succesfull, a text appears and says 'Read and Insert Successfull'. If an exception occured, a text appears and says 'An exception occurred!'
